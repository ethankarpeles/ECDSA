# ECDSA

## Installing Python
All of our code runs on Python 3. To install Python, please do so using this link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

The instructions for installation will depend on the operating system, but you should be able to install it like you would install most other programs.

## PyCryptodome Library Implementation
To install the necessary library for the PyCryptodome library implementation, please run the following command in the terminal.
```
pip install pycryptodome
```
This is the only necessary library to install so that this implementation will function properly.

## ECDSA Library Implementation
To install the necessary library for the ECDSA library implementation, please run the following command in the terminal.
```
pip install ecdsa
```
Please note that while the code for this implementation uses the hashlib and sys libraries, these should be included with the default installation of Python.

## Running the Code
Each Python file (ending in .py) is meant to be executed independently. For any given Python file, the process for executing it will be as follows, assuming all of the required libraries and programs are installed.

Assume we are trying to run an Python file called "file.py". To do this, open a terminal, change the working directory to the folder containing "file.py", and run the following code:
```
python file.py
```
For any of the Python files from this project, you would just change "file.py" out for the name of the file of the program you would like to execute.
